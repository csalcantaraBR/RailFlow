# RailFlow
RailFlow â€” Build the rails, then flow. These templates put ChatGPT into RailFlow mode: once the rails (tests, templates, CI gates) are laid, you mostly monitor and make small corrections, while quality runs automatically.  This README is in English to match the templates; adapt as needed.
